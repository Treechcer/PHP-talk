This app is small "social media" app, where you can send messages with any name that you can change, that'll be store on the server in `db.txt` file and every `200 ms` (0.2s) it refreshes will all new messages. You need to host it though because it's server based (whou would've guessed that "social media" uses servers, right?). This is my small project to learn PHP integration with JS and HTML.
